## Gap Summary

### L002 (K-Elimination Correctness)
- **No gaps** - Fully proven in Coq and Lean 4

### L003 (K-Elimination Information Preservation)
1. **[GAP 1]** Constant-time implementation verification (Low severity)
2. **[GAP 2]** Formal Lean/Coq verification of reduction (Medium severity)

### T001 (K-Enhanced RLWE Security)
1. **[GAP 1]** Formal Lean 4 verification (Medium severity)
2. **[GAP 2]** Multi-sample security extension (Low severity)

---

## Key Results

### Theorem: K-Elimination is Security-Preserving

K-Elimination does NOT weaken RLWE security because:

1. **Determinism**: K-Elimination is a deterministic function of public data
2. **No Secret Access**: The algorithm never touches secret key material
3. **Tight Reduction**: Adv^{K-RLWE}(A) = Adv^{RLWE}(B) (no security loss)
4. **Integer-Only**: All computations use exact integer arithmetic

### Practical Implication

If RLWE with parameters (N, q, sigma) provides lambda-bit security,
then QMNF-HE with K-Elimination provides the SAME lambda-bit security.

## Verification Paths

### For Coq Verification
```bash
cd /home/acid/Projects/NINE65/verified-innovations/proofs/coq
coqc KElimination.v
# Verifies: kElimination_core, kElimination_unique
```

### For Lean 4 Verification
```bash
cd /home/acid/Projects/NINE65/v5/lean4/KElimination
lake build
# Verifies: All KElimination namespace theorems
```

### For Blueprint Tracking
```bash
cat /home/acid/Projects/qmnf-security-proofs/swarm_run/state/blueprint.json | jq '.nodes[] | select(.id | test("L002|L003|T001"))'
```

## Next Steps

1. **Critic Agent**: Review these proof sketches for logical errors
2. **Verifier Agent**: Formalize T001 in Lean 4
3. **Update Blueprint**: Mark L002, L003, T001 as "proof_sketch_complete"
